This repository is for the [live website](https://alec-m13.github.io), hosted by GitHub Pages. My profile is [here](https://github.com/alec-m13/).

This account was my very first GitHub account, and now I use it as a centralized environment to learn new things. Whether that's a computer language, a processing system, or whatever else, if it requires a folder and some files to learn then I put it here.

I create a new repository for each new thing I learn. The repository has the data involved, and I use the wiki of those repositories as a raw log of my progress. Whenever I get stuck on something, I log it there. It's kind of like a live show of how I went from zero to competent.

This website ([here](https://alec-m13.github.io)) is where I present my progress. Any interesting projects are presented, along with any solutions I come up with which are particularly clever or otherwise worthy of sharing.

This repository also serves as my learning of Jekyll, the site builder which GitHub Pages uses. Until making this site I only ever used vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for web design, but now I feel ready to learn a modern approach to site generation. With any luck I cam make this a pretty, elegant site.

A little about me: I (Alec Martin) have always been interested in computers. I started programming with the Lego Mindstorms NXT in middle school, and my first non-GUI programming language was TI-BASIC on my graphing calculator in high school. These both came naturally and were exciting to play with. My crowning achievement was minesweeper on my calculator, at least until it decided to reset its memory and delete my program in the process.

In college I took an introduction to Java course. I loved the language but the class was not particularly challenging. On the first assignment, the classic hello world, I decided I would have some fun and translate "Hello World" into 50 or so languages from around the world. Then every time the program ran it picked one at random to print after the English version. Fun times.

I decided to study mathematics instead of computer science, because I found math to be more challenging and less restrictive. But I've coded up many projects on my own in the meantime. Some of my projects include a brute-force analysis of the game 2048, an audio generation engine in the direction of randomized computer-generated music, and an analysis of the Skewb Ultimate, a variant of the Rubik's cube. None of these projects exist anymore, lost to the ether as old code is wont to do.

Upon graduating college with a double major in mathematics and chemistry, I started a PhD program in mathematics. It's worth mentioning that as a mathemtician in the 21st century it is obligatory to learn LaTeX, and I had some fun programming with that too. While there I came up with some projects related to teaching. It was for these that I learned Git and GitHub, and as a result these projects will exist in perpetuity. They are both open-source with the intention of having a community beyond just me, so I created separate accounts for each. These are [mathpeople.github.io](https://mathpeople.github.io), a study guide tool, and [SCRML](https://scrml.org), a markup language for abstract reasoning.

I finished my PhD in 2021. In the strange and jarring transition out of academia (I didn't want to pursue an academic career) I started learning new computer things. I have always felt that the hardest part of learning something new with computers is getting started. I don't mean motivating yourself to do it; I mean literally downloading the software, initializing whatever needs initializing, and getting enough stuff set up that you can actually start learning the thing. More often than not my entire first day on a nea language is spent stuck in setup. Online tutorials are often not all that much help here -- in my experience the most helpful things are step-by-step directions posted on some forum somewhere. Hence I do not intend to sugarcoat my raw logs. If I struggled with something I will share it in the hopes that someone somewhere (quite possibly me in the future) will find it useful to see a solution to it.

I rebirthed this `alec-m13` profile as my go-to for learning new computer things. I don't know what the future holds for me, but I enjoy learning new things too much to ever let this pursuit completely cease.
