I really wanted to make something in Angular which I felt was worthy of the effort. I came up with a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe which allows for topological operations. I call it Tic-Tac-Toe-pology.

This game has grown into a full fledged topological board game engine. Every time I try moving on I find another way to automate some of the foundational machinery. I know the common pattern that starting off complicated means it won't ever get finished, but I can't resist. I want to make Tic-Tac-Toe-pology logic first then bring it into the visual world with Angular.

So for now my progress on Angular is on pause while I build the Tic-Tac-Toe-pology functionality. But hey, at least that gives me the opportunity to build an API. And I intend to do it well ny splitting up functionality into small units which can be used elsewhere and whatnot. Also the game's theory is just too cool to not figure out.
