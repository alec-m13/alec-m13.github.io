# A Different Project

My other learned (/learning) languages so far have been about creating web content of some kind. That's something which can be done manually but is better practice to have automated systems for. Not so with geographic data.

Geographic data describes the surface of our planet. Cartography, population analyses, and weather prediction are all geographic tasks. This project stands out because there is absolutely no confusion about the practical approach to working with it: geography is too complicated for a custom from-scratch approach.

# GIS

GIS stands for Geographic Information System. It isn't really a language or even a single system but rather a field to itself. In practice it's dominated by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), but Esri's software is [not open source](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/buy). There's nothing wrong with charging for software -- they do great work and deserve to be compensated for it -- but I am just trying to familiarize myself with what GIS is, how it works, and what types of things are possible in it. I'm not interested in anything which isn't open source, at least not yet.

It looks like Quantum GIS (QGIS) is the open-source tool I want to learn. It's been around for a while. Going by the stack exchange posts I've come across (especially the old questions circa 2012) it has had major renovations in recent years which make it much more user-friendly. The current iteration -- QGIS 3 -- appears to be an all-in-one UI which bundles together functionality of much older open-source GIS projects like GRASS. QGIS 3 also has a built-in plugin system to enhance its abilities.

# The Process

I thought the best way to learn GIS would be to follow a tutorial. I found one put out by the CDC [here](https://www.cdc.gov/gis/gis-training.htm) which looks perfect. It's written for heealth care professionals who are unfamiliar with GIS. It starts from the very beginning but omits all the technical details, jumping straight into how to use the system to answer geospatial questions.

There is one catch, though: the tutorial is very specifically written for Esri's flagship product ArcGIS. QGIS is more or less an open source version of ArcGIS, though I'm sure there are technically major fundamental differences.

My goal with this project is to complete the CDC ArcGIS tutorial but using QGIS. I expect some trivial tasks will be difficult since the programs are different, but this way I am forced to do some experimenting and exploring of my own. And that's a great way to learn.
